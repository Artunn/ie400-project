IE 400 Principles of Engineering Management Project for Bilkent University

For this project, we modeled four different optimization problems and solved themusing solvers.
The problem was about helping Santa to make decisions so that the children can receive their gifts. 
We used Google’s ORTools library to model linearand integer programming questions and solve them, and pandas library to read data.

These problems were Location & Traveling Salesman Problem variations.
