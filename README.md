<h2>IE 400 Principles of Engineering Management Project<h2>

<b>Introduction</b><br>
For this project we modeled four different optimization problems and solved them using a solver.
The problem was about helping Santa to make decisions so that the children can receive their gifts. 
We used <i>Google’s ORTools library</i> to model linear and integer programming questions and <i>pandas</i> library to read data.

These problems were <i>Location</i> & <i>Traveling Salesman Problem</i> variations.

Other details can be found in our report and project descriptions.
